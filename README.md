# nsga_2_demo
An example implementation of NSGA-2.

## NSGA-II

### Key Features:
1. **Fast Non-dominated Sorting**: The algorithm sorts the population into different fronts based on dominance. A solution dominates another if it is better in at least one objective and not worse in others.
2. **Crowding Distance**: To maintain diversity, NSGA-II calculates a crowding distance for each solution, which measures how close a solution is to its neighbors in the objective space.
3. **Elitism**: NSGA-II uses elitism to ensure that the best solutions are carried over to the next generation.
4. **Binary Tournament Selection**: Selection is based on both rank (non-domination level) and crowding distance.
5. **Crossover and Mutation**: Genetic operators like crossover and mutation are applied to generate offspring.

### Steps in NSGA-II:
1. **Initialization**: Generate an initial population randomly.
2. **Non-dominated Sorting**: Divide the population into fronts based on dominance.
3. **Crowding Distance Calculation**: Compute the crowding distance for solutions in each front.
4. **Selection**: Use binary tournament selection based on rank and crowding distance.
5. **Crossover and Mutation**: Apply genetic operators to create offspring.
6. **Combine and Reduce**: Combine parent and offspring populations, sort them, and select the top solutions for the next generation.
7. **Repeat**: Iterate until the stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations).

NSGA-II is efficient and widely used in fields like engineering design, machine learning, and operations research. It is particularly useful when trade-offs between conflicting objectives need to be analyzed.
